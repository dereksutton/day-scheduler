# day-scheduler

## Objective
Build a simple one-page app to save a work schedule for a typical 9am - 5pm day. Each time block will be displayed in a different color, depending whether it's a past, present, or future event. The application uses the Day.JS third-party API for fetching and displaying the date/time.
